This Project includes a web app, firebase server and React native mobile app.

The core feature is to use Nfc enabled mobile phone to scan nfc tag and send the check-in time to the web app table.

Nfc Tag would have been recorded its location, so the check-in time is to prove the staff has visited the location.

Cleaners can use this technology to check-in where they have visited and clean at what time.
